# Python_Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals

Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.

To do:
1. Use supervised learning techniques to automate the credit card approval process for banks.

2. Preproccess the data and apply supervised learning techniques to find the best model and parameters for the job. Save the accuracy score from your best model as a numeric variable, best_score. Aim for an accuracy score of at least 0.75. The target variable is the last column of the DataFrame.
